> caos-final-submission


The purpose of this project is to apply CPU Scheduling algorithms using Non-Preemptive Priority and First-Come, 
First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduling,  as well as contiguous memory allocation using Best Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit.

The program was designed and developed using C# to develop the following functions: 

1. Display a homepage for users to access various methods

2. Store and display user input values and calculate the turnaround time and 
burst time according to the CPU Scheduling algorithm selected.

3. Store and display user input values and allocate the process size to the 
appropriate block size according the main memory management allocation selected.
